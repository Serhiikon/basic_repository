My life is in a serious mess,
My baby is gone, there's heavy mental stress
I never knew love but I know it now,
I want to give her my heart, but how how

I never knew love but I know it now,
I want to give her my heart, but how how
How How

Maybe I should buy her a beautiful dress,
Maybe gold and diamonds, and no more stress
I decide to call her, it drives me insane,
Then she's on the line and tells me "Don't be vain"
