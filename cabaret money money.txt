Money makes the world go around
The world go around
The world go around
Money makes the world go around
It makes the world go 'round

A mark, a yen, a buck or a pound
A buck or a pound
A buck or a pound
Is all that makes the world go around
That clinking, clanking sound
Can make the world go 'round

Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money
Money money money...

If you happen to be rich
And you feel like a night's entertainment
You can pay for a gay escapade
If you happen to be rich and alone
And you need a companion
You can ring (ting-a-ling) for the maid
If you happen to be rich
And you find you are left by your lover
And you moan and you groan quite a lot
You can take it on the chin
Call a cab and begin to recover
On your 14-karat yacht! WHAT!?

Money makes the world go around
The world go around
The world go around
Money makes the world go around
Of that we both are sure
*rasberry sound* on being poor!

Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money...
