Nobody gonna take my car
I'm gonna race it to the ground
Nobody gonna beat my car
It's gonna break the speed of sound
Oooh it's a killing machine
It's got everything
Like a driving power big fat tyres
And everything

I love it and I need it I bleed it
Yeah it's a wild hurricane
Alright hold tight
I'm a highway starNobody gonna take my girl
I'm gonna keep her to the end
Nobody gonna have my girl
She stays close on every bend
Oooh she's a killing machine
She's got everything
Like a moving mouth body control
And everything

I love her I need her I seed her
Yeah she turns me on
Alright hold tight
I'm a highway star
Nobody gonna take my head
I got speed inside my brain
Nobody gonna steal my head
Now that I'm on the road again
Oooh I'm in heaven again I've got everything
Like a moving ground throttle control
And everything

I love it and I need it I seed it
Eight cylinders all mine
Alright hold tight
I'm a highway star
Nobody gonna take my car
I'm gonna race it to the ground
Nobody gonna beat my car
It's gonna break the speed of sound
Oooh it's a killing machine
It's got everything
Like a driving power big
Fat tyres and everything

I love it and I need it I bleed it
Yeah it's a wild hurricane
Alright hold tight
I'm a highway star
I'm a highway star
I'm a highway star
